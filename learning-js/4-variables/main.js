// variables can be defined like so, the following is a string and we can use it anywhere
var today = 'Monday'

// For example in the console
console.log('Today is ' + today)

// variables can be a result of some maths
var result = 5 + 5

console.log('The result is ' + result)

// save 4 * 5 in a variable and output it to the console and alert the user with the variable
